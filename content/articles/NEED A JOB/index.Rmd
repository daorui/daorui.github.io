###### I am looking for a job now!!!

I am currently working at McMaster University as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Dr. Alemu Gonsamo’s lab. My research has primarily focused on regional soil biogeochemical dynamics, with a strong emphasis on soil organic carbon (SOC) and its interactions with climate change.

My Research Journey
With years of experience in soil science and environmental modeling, my doctoral research explored sustainable management practices in the North China Plain, aiming to balance greenhouse gas emissions and soil carbon sequestration. Using the DayCent model and integrating data from multiple sources, we analyzed the region’s carbon sequestration efficiency from the 1980s to the 2010s and assessed its future carbon sink potential under different management strategies.

Building upon this foundation, I expanded my expertise into digital soil mapping, leveraging measured soil data, remote sensing, and machine learning techniques to estimate SOC stocks in critical global soil zones and analyze their heterogeneous climate feedbacks.

Currently, my research integrates machine learning algorithms with Earth System Model (ESM) outputs to predict Canadian SOC responses to future climate scenarios, aiming to reduce projection uncertainties and improve long-term carbon cycle modeling.

Exploring New Opportunities
I am actively seeking new opportunities in soil science and environmental data analysis, where I can apply my expertise in big data analytics, geospatial modeling, and machine learning to address critical challenges in soil carbon dynamics, sustainable land management, and climate change mitigation.

I am particularly interested in roles that allow me to:
✅ Analyze large-scale soil datasets to drive actionable insights
✅ Develop predictive models for soil carbon sequestration and climate adaptation
✅ Leverage machine learning and remote sensing to enhance soil health assessments
✅ Collaborate with multidisciplinary teams to address global environmental challenges
