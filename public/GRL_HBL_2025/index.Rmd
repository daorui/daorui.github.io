# Abstract 

Agricultural soils are widely recognized to be capable of carbon sequestration that contributes to mitigating CO2 emissions. To better understand soil organic carbon (SOC) stock dynamics and its driving and controlling factors corresponding with a period of rapid agronomic evolution from the 1980s to the 2010s in the North China Plain (NCP), we collected data from two region-wide soil sampling campaigns (in the 1980s and 2010s) and conducted an analysis of the controlling factors using the random forest model.[... more](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.13898)


# Main results 

![Fig. 1 Study area](images/FIG1.png)

## We selected 10 typical agricultrual counties to conduct the field survey.   

![Fig. 2 SOC changes during the last 30 years on the North China Plain](images/Figure3.jpg)    

## SOC and total nitrogen (N) were largely increased during the last 30 years.

## Crop derived C input were demonstrated as the main driving factor for C enhancement.    

![Fig. 4 SOC change trend with time](images/FIG4.png)   

## SOC increased continously during the last 30 years. 

# Story behind 

## This article was completed in Colorado State University, Thanks Martin and Anna for teaching me the RandomForest. 

## Really appreciate Rich for inviting me to be a visiting scholar at CSU, and providing me infinite help both in academic and life. A lot of good memories there.
