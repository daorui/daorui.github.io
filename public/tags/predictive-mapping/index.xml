Due to variability in peat thickness across a large and heterogeneous landscape, the existing carbon (C) storage estimates for the HBL may contain large uncertainty. Here, we use geospatial variables that are associated with HBL peat formation, age, accumulation, and occurrence to understand the driving factors for peat depth variability and map peat depth and C storage at 30 m spatial resolution.</description></item><item><title>Tibetan C mapping and its driving factors</title><link>https://daorui-han.netlify.app/articles/erl_tp_2022/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Mar 2022 21:13:14 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://daorui-han.netlify.app/articles/erl_tp_2022/</guid><description>published in ‘environmental research letters’, 2022.03
Abstract
The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (TP) accumulated a large amount of organic carbon, while its size and response to environmental factors for the whole area remain uncertain. Here, we synthesized a dataset to date with the largest data volume and broadest geographic coverage over the TP, composing of 7196 observations from multiple field campaigns since the 1980s, and provided a comprehensive assessment of the size and spatial distribution of carbon pools for both plant and soils on the TP using machine learning algorithms.</description></item></channel></rss>
