      <description>published in ‘Global Change Biology’, 2017.09AbstractAgricultural soils are widely recognized to be capable of carbon sequestration that contributes to mitigating CO2 emissions. To better understand soil organic carbon (SOC) stock dynamics and its driving and controlling factors corresponding with a period of rapid agronomic evolution from the 1980s to the 2010s in the North China Plain (NCP), we collected data from two region-wide soil sampling campaigns (in the 1980s and 2010s) and conducted an analysis of the controlling factors using the random forest model.</description>

      <description>published in ‘Plant and Soil’, 2016.05AbstractAimsTry to detect the spatiotemporal dynamics and thecontrolling factors of soil organic carbon (SOC) in theNorth China Plain (NCP) over the last 30 years:1980s-2010s.
MethodsWe investigated the SOC evolution by com-piling data from 32 published papers during the last30 years. Then we examined the spatial pattern andcontrolling factors by analysing a two-period samplingobservations (1980s and 2010s) and multiple explana-tory variables in four typical counties.</description>
