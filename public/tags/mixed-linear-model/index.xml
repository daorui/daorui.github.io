      <description>published in ‘Plant and Soil’, 2016.05AbstractAimsTry to detect the spatiotemporal dynamics and thecontrolling factors of soil organic carbon (SOC) in theNorth China Plain (NCP) over the last 30 years:1980s-2010s.
MethodsWe investigated the SOC evolution by com-piling data from 32 published papers during the last30 years. Then we examined the spatial pattern andcontrolling factors by analysing a two-period samplingobservations (1980s and 2010s) and multiple explana-tory variables in four typical counties.</description>
